## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org/download](http://nodejs.org/download)

On Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.

### Install `js-challenge` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install -g js-challenge
```

The `-g` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with `sudo` like this:

```
sudo npm install --global js-challenge
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions

## Run the workshop

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```

```

You'll see the menu:
