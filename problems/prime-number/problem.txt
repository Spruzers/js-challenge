## The challenge:

Using your knowledge on remainder operator, loop and conditional block:
Create a program that true if the argument is a prime number.
and returns false if the argument is not a prime number.


## Hint:
  - for loop.
  - if..else conditional block.
  - Modulus Operator.

## Example:
it should return true if 3 is passed to it.
it should return false if 6 is provided.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = function (a) {
    // ...
  }

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
