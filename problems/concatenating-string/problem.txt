##Appending Variables to Strings
  Just as we can build a string over multiple lines out of string literals,
  we can also append variables to a string using the plus equals (+=) operator.

  // Example
  var anAdjective = "awesome!";
  var ourStr = "Spruzers is ";
  ourStr += anAdjective;
  // Spruzers is awesome.


## The challenge:

 Create a program that appends the argument passed to the string 'Learning to code is '
 and returns the concatenated string.

##Example:
  - It should return 'Learning to code is crazy' if "crazy" is passed.
  - It should return 'Learning to code is simple' if "simple" is passed.
  - It should return 'Learning to code is awesome' if "awesome" is passed.
  - It should return 'Learning to code is great' if "great" is passed.

## Hint:
  Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:
    module.exports = function (someAdjective) {
      var myStr = "Learning to code is ";
      // Append someAdjective to myStr using the += operator.
      // ...
    }

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
