## Reversing a string.
  Using your knowledge on decrementing for-loop, string length and concatenation.
  Create a program that reverses the argument passed to it and returns the reversed string.

##Example:
  - It should return 'olleH' if "Hello" is passed.
  - It should return '!dlroW' if "World!" is passed.
  - It should return 'dlroW olleH' if "Hello World" is passed.

##Hint:
 - string length property.
 - decrementing for loop.
 - String concatenation.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = function (a) {
    // ...
  }

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
