##Find the Length of a String
  You can find the length of a String value by writing .length after the string variable or string literal.

  "Alan Peter".length; // 10

  For example,
  if we created a variable var firstName = "Charles", we could find out how long the string "Charles" is by using the firstName.length property.

## The challenge:

Using the .length property to count the number of characters in a string:
 Create a program that the returns the length of the argument passed to.

##Example:
  - It should return 5 if "Hello" is passed.
  - It should return 6 if "World!" is passed.
  - It should return 11 if "Hello World" is passed.

Here is some boilerplate code to get you started:

  module.exports = function (a) {
    // ...
  }

Check to see if your program is correct by running this command:

Use `$ADVENTURE_COMMAND verify PROGRAM.js` to verify your program.
